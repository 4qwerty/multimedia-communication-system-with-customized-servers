# Thesis: Software for Group Communication System with the Ability to Create Internal Servers and Multimedia Chats Using Web Technologies

## Abstract
This thesis presents the development of a comprehensive group communication system, emphasizing the creation of internal servers and multimedia chats. The project leverages modern web technologies including Next.js 13, React, Socket.io, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to explore the capabilities of advanced web technologies in building a robust and versatile communication platform. This platform not only supports real-time messaging and multimedia interactions but also offers the flexibility to create and manage internal communication servers.

## System Architecture
The system is built using:
- **Next.js 13 & React**: For a dynamic and responsive front-end user interface.
- **Socket.io**: Facilitating real-time, bidirectional event-based communication.
- **Prisma**: As an ORM for efficient database management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a customizable and modern user interface.
- **Postge**: Using for data storage.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilizing Socket.io for instantaneous messaging.
- **Multimedia Chat Channels**: Creation of text, audio, and video chat channels.
- **Personal and Group Interactions**: Support for one-to-one conversations and group discussions.
- **User and Server Management**: Features for user role management and internal server customization.
- **Responsive Design**: TailwindCSS and ShadcnUI are used for an aesthetically pleasing and functional interface across devices.
- **Security and Authentication**: Implemented using Clerk for secure user access.

## Methodology
This section discusses the detailed methodology for the development of each feature, including the setup of the environment, database configurations, and user interface design.

## Implementation
Step-by-step guide on:
- Cloning the repository: `git@github.com:4qwerty/multimedia-communication-system-with-customized-servers.git`
- Installing packages: `npm i`
- Setting up the environment variables and Prisma.
- Starting the application: `npm run dev`

## Results and Discussion
This section evaluates the functionality of the communication system, its responsiveness, and user feedback.

## Conclusion
The thesis concludes with a summary of the project's achievements in creating a versatile and user-friendly group communication system using web technologies.
